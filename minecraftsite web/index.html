            <p>Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game that allows players to explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world, mine resources, and build structures. It was created by Markus "Notch" Persson and was first released by Mojang Studios in 2011. The game offers various modes, such as Survival (where players gather resources, craft items, and fend off monsters) and Creative (where they have unlimited resources to build without limits).
